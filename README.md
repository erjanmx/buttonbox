> Hello! I am happily announcing that I will not continue the development of buttonbox, that's because buttonbox was nothing more than a project to test my skills and develop a better theme for olivetin. Since people liked the theme I decided that instead of reinventig the wheel and trying to rewrite the entire olivetin app in next js (which is not possible due to some limitations) I can just write the theme people liked. You can check the "buttonbox" theme [here](https://www.olivetin.app/themes/posts/buttonbox/), hope you like it :)

> If you still want to use buttonbox for some reason you can build the docker image `npm run build:image` and launch the buttonbox container with `npm run start:image`

<div align="center">
  <h1>ButtonBox</h1>
  <p>Run your shell tasks with one click</p>
</div>

This project is inspired from [Olivetin](https://www.olivetin.app/), it is the same app but with a more modern UI (and probably less features lol).

### Installation ‚¨áÔ∏è

Right now the installation right now is not that easy but I am working on a solution to install the app easily. For now you need to build the app then run it using node.

Firstly install the requirements:

```bash
npm install
```

Then build the app with this command:

```bash
npm run build
```

Finally run the app:

```bash
npm run start
```

The app should now be listening on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Configuration ‚úèÔ∏è

All the buttons are configured with these 4 options:

| Name          | Description                        | Required |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------- |
| `name`        | The titile of the button.          | yes      |
| `icon`        | The url of the icon to use.        | no       |
| `description` | A small description of the button. | no       |
| `command`     | The command to run.                | yes      |

Here is an example configuration:

```yaml
buttons:
  - name: Hello world!
    description: Echo hello world in the terminal.
    command: echo "Hello, world!"
```
